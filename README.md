This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 related to nested routes and URL parameters.  The issue arises when a parent route includes parameters, and a child route attempts to access those parameters.  The expected behavior is that the child route should inherit the parameters from its parent. However, the child route may not always correctly render if a param is used in the parent route.  The `AppSolution.js` file provides a solution illustrating how to correctly access nested parameters in this scenario.
